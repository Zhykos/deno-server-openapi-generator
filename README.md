<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![Product screenshot](doc/images/client-guide-00.jpg)

Tired of your huge Java monolith that keeps you up at night? _Decaf_ offers you
small and nice cups of coffee by proposing solutions of transformations of your
Java assets including a slicing into micro-services.

Version 1.0 of the project proposes an algorithm which analyses a folder
containing your Java sources and shows you an intelligent and automatic slicing
into subgroups based on Markov clustering[^1].

_Decaf_ is part of a larger project (Soon<sup>TM</sup>) that aims to help you
manage your application monoliths.

SRC{Decaf} (_Decaf_ for short) is a project I imagined after the work of of a
thesis of a colleague (hey
<a href="http://archive.bu.univ-nantes.fr/pollux/show.action?id=be91f105-bf4b-44bc-8b1f-881a23ea99c1">Jonathan</a>).
I have been convinced for several years that his work would be powerful within
the products I worked on at Mia-Software, but it was never decided to go for it.
So I took some personal time to see the feasibility of the project.
