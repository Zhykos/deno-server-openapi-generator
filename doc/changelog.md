Version 0.7.0:

- Remove some anys
- Generate constructors instead of "copyFrom" methods

This is still a beta version: a simple JSON server will work but be warned:
complex requests may fail.

This version is almost valid with the OpenAPI PetStore example (upload won't work).

Check README for more details.
