Version 0.6.0:

- Upgrade to 6.6.0 Codegen
- Generate "options" route for caches
- Add CORS options

This is still a beta version: a simple JSON server will work but be warned:
complex requests may fail.

This version is almost valid with the OpenAPI PetStore example (upload won't work).

Check README for more details.
